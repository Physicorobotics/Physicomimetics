## Physicomimetics

Hello,

My name is Kush Pakki. I am a Senior at Mentor High School.

If you are on this Gitrepo, you probably saw me at NEOSEF or Akron, and (hopefully) perhaps even at ISEF. 

This is the repo where I host all the data and scripts related to my project. This also doubles as my Lab Notebook. The dates do not reflect when I actually made the code, merely when I uploaded everything.  

I would also like to apologize in advance for the sometimes confusing nomenclature of the files, but alas this is a Science project not a development project, so I didn't follow all the syntax rules of programming. This means CamelCase was mixed in with underline_naming with variables that really have no naming system at all. Also I basically dumped all my files into the repo, so nothing is really organized.

Feel free to clone the repo or even add to the Repo if you wish. 

Thanks,
Kush Pakki
